Affirm: FinTech Company Case Study
(UCB FinTech Bootcamp, Module 1 Challenge)


## Overview and Origin 


Affirm Holdings, Inc. (dba Affirm) was incorporated in 2012. Founders were Max Levchin (founder and CEO, also PayPal co-founder, contributed to  development of CAPTCHA test, early investor in Yelp), 
Jeffrey Kaditz and Nathan Gettings

They had an idea to streamline and simplify credit purchases for customers.

The founders observed that typical retail customers were spending substantial amounts of money for using traditional credit cards as means of purchase. According to Affirm, the average U.S. household has $6,000 in credit card debt. Much of the debt was created by the “interest on interest” characteristic of credit card use.

They developed a service that featured a BNPL(buy now, pay later) model that was simplified, streamlined, and  more transparent for credit purchases by customers. Instead of loans with compounding interest and excess fines Affirm provides simple-interest loans.

Affirm has had 12 rounds of funding since its inception raising $1.5B.
Affirm’s IPO was held on Jan 13, 2021 with IPO valuation at $ 12B.

## Business Activities 


Affirm aims to make credit retail purchases simpler and to provide flexibility for customers to pay over time.

Affirm’s intended customer is any shopper who would like to purchase relatively expensive items with a simplified credit. An example is a popular exercise bicycle - Peloton. Their products retail at around $2,000 - $2,500. Peloton announced that close to one fifth of Affirm’s revenue was accounted from Peloton.

Affirm is currently only available only in the US, but it would like to operate outside of the US as well, specifically in the UK. Any countries with an established consumer credit system is a potential source of expansion.

Affirm’s model is to simplify consumers’ experience through using credit/loan. Affirm can collect commissions from sellers and/or charge simple interest to buyers. It never charges fees of any kind to the consumers.


For operations, Affirm uses various programming languages like RxJava, Swift, HTML5, SQL and Ruby.

Further, Affirm uses tools to enhance productivity. These include: AWS CodePipeline, Gradle, Babel and WebdriverIO.

In addition, for development and analytics Affirm partners with or uses Google Analytics, Facebook Pixel, Adobe Fonts, Salesforce and Medium.

For For its service development and core analytics, Affirm heavily uses Machine Learning. For example, it allows them to asses, analyze data points to make real-time credit decisions.

## Recommendations


With the rapid growth of available data and computing power, resulting in AI proliferation in businesses of all sizes, Affirm has an opportunity to leverage its assets and personnel in entering many FinTech businesses.

Similar to  MoneyGram and WesternUnion, Affirm could start offering  peer-to-peer money transfer services. On a high level, for this it would need to change customer-merchant model to customer-customer.

While this could be seen as a relatively undisturbed exercise, Affirm would need to deal with the legal infrastructure for state-to-state or country-to-country money transfers. Also, determining the legality of new customers would pose a challenging enterprise.
